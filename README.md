# Land-Usage-in-Five-Counties
This script allowed use to compute the Land usage of 5 counties in the state of Iowa.

This had been a group project that I had co led. It was our final project for high performance computing. We where able to grab some TIF files that outline a large group 
of counties in the state of Iowa. With also having the shape file of all county outlines in our country, we could cut out the counties we wanted by matching the coordinates
and iterate through use a geopands to grab the pixel values. 

With the pixel values we could see what was most prominent in each county and see how the values grew over the 12 year period. This is all shown with a dynamic graph. 

Enjoy!
